# recipe-website-demo
I made this static webstie has a demo of a recipe site. The page doesn't actually change. 
You click a button and the websites content changes. It's functionally the same as any other website. 
aside from the fact it's difficult to format the content with the <br> tag. 
Because all the information is stored as a string it's hard to format properly. Im sure theres a way I just havent figured out yet.

I believe this kind of website it great for personal projects. I'd like to make these wbesites more dynamic in the future.
Maybe I'll try running these on a webserver in go. idk who I'm typing this for. employers maybe? If you're an employer
